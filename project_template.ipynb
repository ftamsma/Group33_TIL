    "The bin packing is an Operational Research technique. It is simular to the knapsack problem, however the knapsack problem is a maximization problem where the purpuse is to fill a fixed-size knapsack with the most valuable items. Whereas in the binpacking problem all items should be assigned and the purpose is to minimize the number of used bins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the supply chain various **examples/applications** can be found where a bin packing problem is encountered. From assigning cargo to airplains or containers to assigning packages to trucks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective for this research is a model that is able to optimize the allocation of packages to vehicles. This is first done with one type of vehicle with the same charateristics. From this model the model will be extended so it can optimize the same problem with different types of vehicles that can be used and eventually the emissions of the vehicles will be considered as well.
